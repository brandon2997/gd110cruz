    <H2><i>My Bio</i></H2>
    <p style="font-size: 24px;">Hello my name is Brandon I'm from a small city in long island New york, Yes that line next to New york on the map. That line is were I've spent all my life. It was an okay place only thing was there not much to do there. Only go the beach or drive around and as person who can't swin or drive yet get bored. which means I had to finds stuff to entertaim myself. So thats why I'd find myself playing games and watching videos about dumbs stuff. When I gotten bored of those things I did stuff in school. Like the time I was in 4th grade i sing with my schools choirs the national anthem at an NHL game. or the time in Junior year of high shcool I Judge on actual court trial in my towns court. When I wasn't entertaiming myself I was work at my local hardware store. Where I help stop a shoplifter and<em> work during a blackout</em>. So that little about me and what I did before before coming to NEIT.  </p>
